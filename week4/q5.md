**Consider the following code blocks which generate the same output.**

#### **1. (7 points) Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.**
 -   _Approach 1_ is a function that takes a number parameter that denotes
    what the for loop will iterate to. And for each number it iterates, it will be multiplied by 2 and appended to a list which         is then returned by the function. Then the function is called in the for loop to print the values.
  -  _Approach 2_ directly creates the list in the for loop iterator given the number 5 and prints out the numbers.
   - _Approach 3_ also takes a parameter much like approach 1 but instead of appending the calculated value into a list it returns/yields a sequence of numbers after multiplying it so it could be used as 'i' in the print iterator.

#### **1. (3 points) What type of function is `doubleG(n)`? What is the advantage of using such a function?**
`doubleG(n)` is a generator function, the advantage of using such a function is that it is more memory efficient as it does not need to allocate as much space to calculate the values as opposed to using a list which you need to use more memory right off the bat to assign it to values.
