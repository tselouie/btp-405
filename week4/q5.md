5. (10 points) Consider the following code blocks which generate the same output.
    1. (7 points) Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.
    Approach one is a function that takes a number parameter that denotes
    what the for loop will iterate to. And for each number it iterates, it will be multiplied by 2 and appended to a list which is then returned by the function. Then the function is called in the for loop to print the values.

    Approach 2 directly creates the list in the for loop iterator given the number 5
    and prints out the numbers.

    Approach 3 also takes a parameter much like approach 1 but instead of appending the calculated value into a list it returns/yields a sequence of numbers after multiplying it so it could be used as 'i' in the print iterator.

    2. (3 points) What type of function is `doubleG(n)`? What is the advantage of using such a function?
    
    doubleG(n) is a generator function, the advantage of using such a function is that it is more memory efficient as it does not need to allocate as much space to calculate the values as opposed to using a list which you need to use more memory right off the bat to assign it to values.
